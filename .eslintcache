I create story posts as well as post content on the Instagram and Facebook page. I am passionate about art and how it coincides with business. Over quarantine I started my own press on nails business. In my free time I love to workout, play volleyball, swim, bake and hang out with friends! I'm always down for an adventure and love to try out new things.`\r\n}","C:\\Users\\joshtayo\\Documents\\ru-bits-v2\\src\\components\\Landing.js",["121","122"],{"ruleId":"123","replacedBy":"124"},{"ruleId":"125","replacedBy":"126"},{"ruleId":"123","replacedBy":"127"},{"ruleId":"125","replacedBy":"128"},{"ruleId":"129","severity":1,"message":"130","line":1,"column":17,"nodeType":"131","messageId":"132","endLine":1,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"129","severity":1,"message":"133","line":1,"column":27,"nodeType":"131","messageId":"132","endLine":1,"endColumn":36},{"ruleId":"129","severity":1,"message":"134","line":7,"column":12,"nodeType":"131","messageId":"132","endLine":7,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"129","severity":1,"message":"135","line":7,"column":20,"nodeType":"131","messageId":"132","endLine":7,"endColumn":29},{"ruleId":"136","severity":1,"message":"137","line":20,"column":25,"nodeType":"138","endLine":20,"endColumn":90},{"ruleId":"136","severity":1,"message":"137","line":31,"column":25,"nodeType":"138","endLine":31,"endColumn":92},{"ruleId":"136","severity":1,"message":"137","line":40,"column":25,"nodeType":"138","endLine":40,"endColumn":95},{"ruleId":"129","severity":1,"message":"134","line":7,"column":12,"nodeType":"131","messageId":"132","endLine":7,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"129","severity":1,"message":"135","line":7,"column":20,"nodeType":"131","messageId":"132","endLine":7,"endColumn":29},{"ruleId":"139","severity":1,"message":"140","line":11,"column":9,"nodeType":"138","endLine":11,"endColumn":49},{"ruleId":"141","severity":1,"message":"142","line":43,"column":87,"nodeType":"143","endLine":43,"endColumn":102},{"ruleId":"141","severity":1,"message":"142","line":44,"column":91,"nodeType":"143","endLine":44,"endColumn":106},{"ruleId":"141","severity":1,"message":"142","line":45,"column":106,"nodeType":"143","endLine":45,"endColumn":121},{"ruleId":"141","severity":1,"message":"142","line":46,"column":97,"nodeType":"143","endLine":46,"endColumn":112},{"ruleId":"141","severity":1,"message":"142","line":47,"column":77,"nodeType":"143","endLine":47,"endColumn":92},{"ruleId":"129","severity":1,"message":"144","line":2,"column":8,"nodeType":"131","messageId":"132","endLine":2,"endColumn":18},{"ruleId":"141","severity":1,"message":"142","line":13,"column":34,"nodeType":"143","endLine":13,"endColumn":49},{"ruleId":"123","replacedBy":"145"},{"ruleId":"125","replacedBy":"146"},{"ruleId":"129","severity":1,"message":"147","line":4,"column":8,"nodeType":"131","messageId":"132","endLine":4,"endColumn":17},{"ruleId":"148","severity":1,"message":"149","line":1,"column":1,"nodeType":"150","endLine":23,"endColumn":2},{"ruleId":"129","severity":1,"message":"151","line":3,"column":8,"nodeType":"131","messageId":"132","endLine":3,"endColumn":17},{"ruleId":"129","severity":1,"message":"152","line":4,"column":8,"nodeType":"131","messageId":"132","endLine":4,"endColumn":12},"no-native-reassign",["153"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["154"],["153"],["154"],"no-unused-vars","'useState' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","'useEffect' is defined but never used.","'active' is assigned a value but never used.","'setActive' is assigned a value but never used.","jsx-a11y/img-redundant-alt","Redundant alt attribute.
